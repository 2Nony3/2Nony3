# Hi there 👋

I'm Anthony Mousaoubaa — a Software Engineering student at Concordia University with a passion for full-stack development, hackathons, and building impactful tech solutions.

- 🛠️ I recently led the development of [**AquaScan**](https://github.com/2Nony3) — an AI-powered mobile app that identifies fish species and fetches real-time fishing regulations in Quebec. It won 🥇1st place at **PolyHacks 2025**!
- 💡 Built [**Casper.Ai**](https://github.com/2Nony3) at McGill’s McHacks 12 — a situational judgment test simulator for medical students to practice for the CASPer exam.
- 👨‍🏫 As a former instructor at Groupe STIM, I taught computer programming to students and teachers from kindergarten to 6th grade.
- 🤝 I'm always open to collaborating on full-stack web apps, AI tools, and anything that makes a positive impact.
